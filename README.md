# SehhaChain
***
In the current healthcare system, patients have their health in formation spread over multiple systems, hospitals, networks and maybe even countries!
There are multiple medical records from the same patient, at different hospitals all with their own snapshot of the patient’s health at that time of their interaction with them, like x-rays… etc.

SehhaChain will arrange all of these records and filter them into specific categories to better data handling. Such categorization would make the records more accessible and understandable for patients and it will also facilitate researchers in searching for the information relevant to what they want.
SehhaChain provides the user, the owner of their medical records, full access and control over their data.
The user will have the capability to provide differing levels of access to various users, by assigning a set of access permissions and designating who can read and write data to their blockchain, and decide on the duration of the grant.


## SehhaChain Features:
***
1. Data Security:
The security of health records is secured beyond any centralized data system currently in use. Patient data is not accessible directly on the blockchain.
The blockchain acts as a pointer to where patient data is held in an encrypted format, meaning that anyone attempting to intercept patient data will be unable to with the ease that is required to access data existing in any central location.

2. Promote Research Based on the Vast Data:
 A large base of structured data with good data model - no need to get approval for case study in researches.
 Deidentified ID that could be linked to cases for research and secure patients privacy.
 
 3. Patient Safety:
 A patient can approve or decline healthcare professionals access to their records. However, in the event of an emergency and with the patient unconscious, there must be an ability to view certain information in order to provide the best possible care.
 The most vital information needed in an emergency would be the patient’s name, their next of kin, medications, allergies and any sensitive decisions they may have made. Patients using SehhaChain will have the ability to select in advance which areas of their records can be viewed in an emergency situation.
