# SehhaChain
***
In the current healthcare system, patients have their health in formation spread over multiple systems, hospitals, networks and maybe even countries!
***
There are multiple medical records from the same patient, at different hospitals all with their own snapshot of the patient’s health at that time of their interaction with them, like x-rays… etc.

***SehhaChain will arrange all of these records and filter them into specific categories to better data handling. Such categorization would make the records ***more accessible and understandable for patients and it will also facilitate researchers in searching for the information relevant to what they want.
***SehhaChain provides the user, the owner of their medical records, full access and control over their data.
***The user will have the capability to provide differing levels of access to various users, by assigning a set of access permissions and designating who can read and write data to their blockchain, and decide on the duration of the grant.
